            <h2>How does Google protect my privacy and keep my information secure? <i class="fa-solid fa-minus"></i></h2>
            <p class="ans ansShow">We're constantly working to ensure strong security, protect your privacy, and make Google even more
                effective and efficient for you. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on security, and
                employ world-renowned experts in data security to keep your information safe. We also built easy-to-use
                privacy and security tools like Google Dashboard, 2-step verification, and personalized ad settings
                found in My Ad Center. So when it comes to the information you share with Google, you’re in control.</p>

            <h2>How can I remove information about myself from Google's search results? <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></h2>
            <p  class="ans">Google search results are a reflection of the content publicly available on the web. Search engines can’t remove content directly from websites, so removing search results from Google wouldn’t remove the content from the web. If you want to remove something from the web, you should contact the webmaster of the site the content is posted on and ask him or her to make a change. Once the content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google’s search results. If you have an urgent removal request, you can also visit our help page for more information.</p>

            <h2>Are my search queries sent to websites when I click on Google Search results? <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></h2>
            <p  class="ans">Typically, no. When you click on a search result in Google Search, your web browser sends certain information to the destination webpage. Your search terms may appear in the Internet address, or URL, of the search results page, but Google Search is intended to prevent browsers from sending that URL to the destination page as the Referrer URL. We provide data about search queries via Google Trends and Google Search Console, but when we do, we aggregate queries together so that we only share queries issued by multiple users.</p>

            <h2>Why is my account associated with a region? <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></h2>
            <p class="ans">If the region associated with your account doesn’t correspond to your region of residence, it could be because of a difference between your region of work and residence, because you’ve installed a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to mask your IP address, or because you live close to a territorial border. If you disagree with the region associated with your account, submit a request to change your region.</p>
